# python-capstone-finance-tracker

This is a simple command-line Python program that helps users track their personal expenses. Users can add expenses with descriptions, categories, and amounts, view all expenses, and see a summary of spending by category.

The project demonstrates practical use of functions, data structures, and exception handling to simulate a real-world finance tracking tool.

Functions: for organizing reusable logic (e.g., adding expenses, viewing summaries)

Dictionaries: to group expenses by category

Tuples: to store individual expenses as (description, amount)

Loops: for menu navigation and repeated user input

Exception Handling: using try, except, and finally blocks to handle invalid input

String formatting: for clear and user-friendly output

__name__ == "__main__": to run the main menu loop when executed directly
